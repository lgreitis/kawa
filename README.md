# Kawa - Anime streaming app.

## ðŸš§ Currently Under Development ðŸš§

The core functionality of the app is largely complete, though it may lack some features users typically expect from an anime streaming app. While Windows builds are available for download, MacOS and Linux users will need to build the app themselves.

# About

**Problem:** Current anime sites are crap, and they go down constantly.

**Solution:** A standalone app where extensions provide the content (currently supporting torrent sources only). Your anime list is synced with [MAL](https://myanimelist.net/) and watch progress is saved in app. Enjoy anime without ads with amazing quality and without the risk of the site going down.

# Development

All you should need is Node.js and yarn. Setup the .env file with .env.example guide and run `yarn install` and `yarn dev` to start the app.

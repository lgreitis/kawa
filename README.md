# Kawa - Anime streaming app.

## ðŸš§ Currently Under Development â€“ Not Ready for Use ðŸš§

# About

**Problem:** Current anime sites are crap, and they go down when they get DMCA'd.

**Solution:** A standalone app where extensions provide the content. Your anime list is synced with [MAL](https://myanimelist.net/) and watch progress is saved in app. Enjoy anime without ads with amazing quality and without the risk of the site going down.

# Development

All you should need is Node.js and yarn. Setup the .env file with .env.example guide and run `yarn install` and `yarn dev` to start the app.
